OpenMEEG: forward problems solver in the field of EEG and MEG
=============================================================

The OpenMEEG software is a C++ package for solving the forward
problems of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).

OpenMEEG is distributed under the French opensource license CeCILL-B. It is
