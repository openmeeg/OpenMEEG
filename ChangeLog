Dev version:

Improvements:
	- Add "-d" option to om_check_geom to check if dipoles are within
	  the inner interface.

Release 2.4:
	
New features:
	- handles non-nested geometries: domains can have several neighbors as long as their
	  conductivity is constant and isotropic.
	- handles zero-conductivity domains (modeling ventricles or silicone material)
	- CGAL meshing tools (allowing to remesh or decimate existing meshes,
	  or to mesh a levelset)
	- can use linear algebra packages MKL and OpenBLAS, on all platforms (linux, MacOS and Windows) 

Improvements:
	- support for VTK mesh formats

Release 2.1:
New features:
	- added the adjoint way for computing a leadfield for either EEG, MEG or
	  MEEG simultaneously. This save a lot of time and memory for big systems (>1000 pts/surfaces).

Improvements:
	- better ordering in computations when inverting the matrix for the memory footprint.
	- storage now more effective using the matio library even for symmetric matrices.
	- support for matlab7.3 file format.
	- reducing memory footprint of DSM, Head2MEG, SurfSource2MEG and DipSource2MEG computations
	- improved MKL detection
	- lapack inclusion (experimental) to ease the build on architectures where
	there is no alternative.

Bug corrections:
	- allowance of spaces in mesh file names with a new .geom format (old
	  format is still accepted).
	- bug when loading sensor file with no empty line at the end
	- fix leak in Mesh class

Removed features:
    - TV inverse solver

Release 2.0:

Release 1.1:

New features:
	- added target for uninstalling (make uninstall).
	- possibility of evaluating the potential at any point within inner volume.
	- for Functional Electric Stimulation: added a new criterion to optimize: current activation.

Improvements:
	- support for MKL-10.0 on MacOS.
	- added the possibility of statically linked libraries for easier distribution (unix only).
	- more information on mesh qualify in om_mesh_info.
	- more tests (mostly for EIT tests).
	- do not use optimized operator D when using OpenMP.
	- automatic finding of fortan libraries (for unix), better blas/lapack/atlas detection.
	- build system updated for cmake 2.6

Bug corrections:
	- corrected a misprint help message and adding a message if not enough arguments are given.
	- corrected the magnitude of MEG leadfields, update the tests accordingly.
	- added some missing guards against multiple .H inclusion.
	- correctly initialized matrices before filling them.
	- corrected handling of single layer models.
	- corrected the order of atlas libraries in link.

Code clean up: 
	- non-templated versions of the operatorsN,D,S ; the order of the parameters have been slightly changed .
	- use namespaces everywhere, prefix include guard variables by OPENMEEG_.
	- removed unnecessary info in file headers.
	- matlab io files.
