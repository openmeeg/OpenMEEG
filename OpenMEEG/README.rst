OpenMEEG: forward problems solver in the field of EEG and MEG
=============================================================

The OpenMEEG software is a C++ package for solving the forward
problems of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).

OpenMEEG is distributed under the French opensource license CeCILL-B. It is
intended to give users the freedom to modify and redistribute the software.
It is therefore compatible with popular opensource licenses such as the GPL
and BSD licenses. The CeCILL-B license imposes to anybody distributing a
software incorporating OpenMEEG the obligation to give credits (by citing the
appropriate publications), in order for all contributions to be properly
identified and acknowledged.

Install precompiled binaries
----------------------------

`Download precompiled binaries <https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=435>`_ of the latest stable version.

Or on Mac OS install with `Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_::

    $ brew install openmeeg

On Ubuntu/Debian GNU Linux you can use the http://neuro.debian.net package repository.

Build OpenMEEG
--------------

Unix (Linux & Mac OS X)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Ubuntu/Debian you will need to install the dependencies with::

    sudo apt-get install git-core gcc g++ make cmake libatlas-base-dev python-numpy python-dev swig

On Fedora and Centos::

    sudo yum install git-core gcc make cmake wget perl atlas-devel blas-devel numpy python-devel

On Mac OS X, you'll need `CMake <http://www.cmake.org>`_ (install it with `Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_ or `Fink <http://www.finkproject.org/>`_ or `Macports <http://www.macports.org/>`_ or by direct download).

Then from a terminal::

    $ git clone --recursive git://github.com/openmeeg/openmeeg.git

or if it does not work try::

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/openmeeg/openmeeg.git

then::

    $ cd openmeeg
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_PROGRESSBAR=ON ..
    $ make

If you want the support for:

-VTK, you will need to add "-DUSE_VTK=ON" to the cmake line above.

-Python, you will need to add "-DENABLE_PYTHON=ON".

-Parallel computation with OpenMP, add "-DUSE_OMP=ON".

Then you can run the test suite with::

    $ make test

If no test is failing you can install with::

    $ make install

You should now be able to run the *om_assemble* command and see something like this::

    $ om_assemble
    om_assemble version 2.2.dev (802) compiled at Sep 20 2011 11:50:08

    Not enough arguments
    Please try "om_assemble -h" or "om_assemble --help "

In some Linux distributions (AMD64/X86_64) you may see some errors like this::

    Error while loading shared libraries: libOpenMEEG.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

OpenMEEG puts its libraries in "/usr/local/lib64", which is not included
in your loader's search path. If so, run this command as root::

    # echo '/usr/local/lib64/' >> /etc/ld.so.conf && ldconfig

Now you can try to run the *om_assemble* again.

You can now give a try to OpenMEEG on the `sample dataset <https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/29059/openmeeg_sample_dataset.zip>`_.

Windows
^^^^^^^

You will need to install visual studio, `CMake <http://www.cmake.org>`_ and the
`Intel MKL library <http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/>`_.
Then download the source from github, load the CMake.exe GUI, set the proper option
and generate the visual studio project. You can then open it and build the project.

Using OpenMEEG
--------------

Have a look into data/README.rst for defining your geometry.
and/or
specify to cmake "-DBUILD_TUTORIALS=ON", and read the tutorials in pdf.
